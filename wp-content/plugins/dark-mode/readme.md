# Dark Mode

Lets your users make the WordPress admin dashboard darker.

## Contribute

If you would like to make WordPress more visually appealing in the dark, please contribute! Styling the entirety of the dashboard is a huge task we need people to help!

Ideally, Dark Mode will one day be a part of the WordPress Core. Until then, we need people to help design, build and test this feature to ensure it's worthy of being included.

## Installation & Setup

It's really easy to get started with contributing to the Dark Mode plugin. You'll need to make sure you're using a fairly [recent version of Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - a CSS preprocessor - of at least version 4.0 or above.

Pull down the latest files from the repository and then `cd` into the plugin directory at `/wp-content/plugins/dark-mode`. From there, run the following command to start auto compiling your CSS changes.

```
sass --watch darkmode.scss:darkmode.css --style compressed
```

When you're done, push your changes into a forked version of the repository and submit a pull request on GitHub.
